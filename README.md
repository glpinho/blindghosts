# BLIND GHOSTS

Welcome to my attempt at making a Pacman clone with C. Since I haven't put the time to add a system to guide the ghosts towards the player with pathfinding, the direction of their movement is just random, thus the name "Blind Ghosts".

## Compilation

In order to compile and run this game, just run the following:

```bash
gcc pacman.c movement.c map.c -o blindghosts.out
./blindghosts.out
```
